I'm **Thomas Vroylandt**, a data analyst. 

I work as a freelance at [Tillac](https://www.tillac-data.com/) where I do R dashboard and analytics for my clients. I'm also a statistician at [Pôle emploi](http://www.pole-emploi.org/statistiques-analyses/), a French administration for employment. Previously I have worked at the [Ministery for Health and Social Affaires](https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/). 

I graduated from a [master degree in Sociology and Statistics](http://master-sciences-sociales.ens.fr/qess-presentation/) at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS).

My [CV](pdf/cv_vroylandt.pdf) (in French) and [Linkedin](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/thomas-vroylandt-9a2334190) can tell you more details.

I had the occasion to [publish](publi/) several things, such as paper articles, analysis or lectures notes.

I work mostly with R and you can find some of my code on [Github](https://github.com/tvroylandt) and some of my opinions (mostly about data science) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tvroylandt).

I also like playing badminton and was for a long time involved in scouting.
