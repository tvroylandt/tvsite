<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>Thomas Vroylandt</strong>, a data analyst.</p>
<p>I work as a freelance at <a href="https://www.tillac-data.com/">Tillac</a> where I do R dashboard and analytics for my clients. I&rsquo;m also a statistician at <a href="http://www.pole-emploi.org/statistiques-analyses/">Pôle emploi</a>, a French administration for employment. Previously I have worked at the <a href="https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/">Ministery for Health and Social Affaires</a>.</p>
<p>I graduated from a <a href="http://master-sciences-sociales.ens.fr/qess-presentation/">master degree in Sociology and Statistics</a> at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS).</p>
<p>My <a href="pdf/cv_vroylandt.pdf">CV</a> (in French) and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/thomas-vroylandt-9a2334190">Linkedin</a> can tell you more details.</p>
<p>I had the occasion to <a href="publi/">publish</a> several things, such as paper articles, analysis or lectures notes.</p>
<p>I work mostly with R and you can find some of my code on <a href="https://github.com/tvroylandt">Github</a> and some of my opinions (mostly about data science) on <a href="https://twitter.com/tvroylandt">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>I also like playing badminton and was for a long time involved in scouting.</p>
